# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
The search pa list is like a conjunction, connecting the two didfferent programs together. Combining the pattern/source list that removes the info from the words, to the function that returns the movie answer to the inputed data.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added the Barbie movie, it was made in 2023, I added it because it was funny.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added a pattern action list that would give the actors if someone asks who was in a movie because it is a common way to ask the question.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
a chat bot to tell the weather, so that finding the weather is easier. It would give chance of rain, sun, and temperature depending on the question for a length of time that the user requests.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
Definitely the pa list because all the small acronyms were throwing me off and it was hard to find out which did what and it made the overall coding difficult to create.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes.
